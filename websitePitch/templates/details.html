									<h3>Mission Statment</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Today we move the time intensive task of <em>parking</em> and push it to the way side. We at <strong>Six Points</strong> are revolutionizing the way you park. Our new integrated tech, will allow your Android&trade; powered smart phone to find the closest- most convenient parking spot on campus.</p>

								<p>The point of this is not only to save time before class or work, but to fix a problem that's been years in the making. It's time things change. For too long have we as a student body, faculty, and staff, have had to struggle to find parking. We have wasted hours- if not <strong>days</strong> of our time looking for parking, only to find a spot off in the corner. Then you come back after a long hard day of studying in the library to find that your <em>spot</em> wasn't that at all, but instead you find a ticket. The line that was once there defining the parking space has been gone for some time, and you owe the University yet another twenty dollars. Have you have this happen to you?  We here- and we're sick of it.</p>
